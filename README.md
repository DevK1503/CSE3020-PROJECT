# CSE3020-PROJECT
Predictive analysis of performance of Olympic athletes
The Olympic Games, a pinnacle of human athletic achievement, have served as a testament to the evolution of sports and athleticism for over a century. This project embarks on a comprehensive journey through the data of Olympic athletes spanning 120 years, with the primary aim of uncovering patterns, trends, and insights that illuminate the progress of sports and the athletes who compete on this global stage.​

Our analysis encompasses a wide array of dimensions, including but not limited to, athlete demographics, performance metrics, participation trends, and the impact of socio-cultural factors on Olympic excellence. Through the application of machine learning, data mining techniques, statistical analysis, and visualization tools, we delve into the rich historical dataset of Olympic records, capturing 120 years of athletics.​

Key areas of exploration include the evolution of Olympic sports, the changing demographics of athletes, the influence of technology and training methods, and the correlation between geopolitical events and Olympic performance. Additionally, we investigate the emergence of new sports, gender equality in Olympic participation, and the role of age in athletic success.​

This project not only offers a comprehensive retrospective of the Olympic Games but also provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the world of sports, from coaches and athletes seeking to optimize performance to policymakers aiming to promote inclusivity and diversity in athletics.​

Through our analysis, we aim to shed light on the remarkable journey of athletes who have strived for excellence on the world's grandest stage and contribute to the ongoing discourse on the ever-evolving landscape of Olympic competition.
